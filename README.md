# AWS-Financial-Reporting
A nifty tool that generates an excel report of the great cost difference of accounts in an organisation compared to the previous month. It will then also show the greatest AWS service costs per account as well. Finally bar graphs will be created for cost differences where accounts are grouped into team verticals.


Report Outputs:
Excel Sheet Named eg 'March24' comparing March24 costs to the previous month.
